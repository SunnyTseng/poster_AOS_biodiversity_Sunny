### Title 

Broad-scaled Bird Biodiversity Assessment with Autonomous Recording Units

### Introduction

Advances in the hardware and software had made broad-scaled acoustic monitoring of bird biodiversity possible. We deployed a broad-scaled project to investigate the advantages and challenges of using acoustic monitoring in bird biodiversity monitoring. 

### Methods

-	Location: John Prince Research Forest in central British Columbia, Canada
-	Tool: Autonomous recording units (ARUs) with 66 units deployed in 3 years (2020, 2021, and 2022 summer). We used BirdNET as the sound classifier with human validation. 


### Results

-	Systematical deploy of ~ 50 ARUs with ~2500 ARU days would be sufficient effort in surveying bird composition in the JPRF area, which is around 16,000 hectares in interior BC. 
-	There are 120 species detected in the JPRF area, with ARU detecting similar number of species (96) than human observers (93). 
-	ARUs is better at picking up rare but vocal species (i.e., crane, owls, woodpeckers). And worse for rare non-vocal species (i.e., collared dove, peregrine falcon), species not making sound frequently (i.e., bittern, ruffed grouse, calliope hummingbird), or far away from deployment sites (i.e., grebe, ducks).
-	Bird richness is higher in sites with lower canopy height, shorter distance to water, and older forest age (>80 yr).  


### Conclusion

ARUs, combined with advanced sound classifier, is an (time, cost, labor) efficient method to survey bird community in JPRF area, across broad spatiotemporal scale. Subsequent analysis can inform important forest features for bird biodiversity. 


## Poster design

Printing company:

- [Fabric poster printing](https://posterandsign.com/products/fabric-research-poster-med-36x48?variant=42769830477987) can be done within 2 - 3 work days. Pick up in downtown Vancouver.

- Poster size is 36 by 48 inch, with price $82 CAD

I will be using these two platforms for designing: 

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/): an image editor for most of the visual design, including digital drawing.

- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/): a design tool for presentations and social media. I will be using canva for the text design.
